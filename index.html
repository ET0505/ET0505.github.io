                            RestauRate is a web-based application that enables users to generate reviews for restaurants based on the restaurant's name, suburb, city, cuisine, rating, and any comments. Users are also able to view the details of each previous review and pinpoint the location of the restaurant on an interactive map. Administrators can access a dashboard through login, and be able to view analytics and delete user-generated reviews.

                            This application was developed as a passion project, combining my interests in full-stack development and personal finance. Through my own financial journey, I discovered that setting measurable goals and celebrating the small wins are essential for maintaining motivation and ensuring consistent progress. Inspired by this experience, I developed this tool to visualise my personal timeline and support others to succeed.
