Hi! I'm Edward Truong, an aspiring frontend software engineer. I'm a Master of Computer Science student who is passionate about learning software development skills. Currently, I'm building new projects and looking for opportunities to grow and contribute to real-world solutions.

I have hands-on expereince programming in Python, Java, C, and JavaScript, and I'm always looking to learn new languages. I enjoy building projects from the ground up and especially love to experiment and work on the frontend. Check out some of my projects!
